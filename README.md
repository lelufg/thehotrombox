Welcome to The HotROM Box Repo!
===================


Hey guys! I am "lelufg" (a.k.a spamtheboss) and this is the Official HRB Repository. Here you can find all the source code of every single version of this Tool. You can also **Modify** it and **Study** for yourself!

Starters Guide
-------------

This guide will teach you the basics of The HotROM Box.

> **Editing**

> - HRB just have **ONE** editable file: *hrb.bat* for windows and *hrb.sh* for Linux (Debian based)
> - Are you a developer? Wanna help me? Fork this repo and mention me, I will appreciate the effort!
> - Make sure to know what strings you're editing, otherwise it can brick the code and the whole tool *(and don't blame me because of that lmao)*

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> HRB in more languages

I actually have no plannings on translating this tool. Maybe in a proper future, who knows.

#### <i class="icon-hdd"></i> Saving and using it

Check "releases" folder, source files will be there, but only the main ones. (not twrp nor adb and fastboot)

> **Fast hint:** If you want to test the whole package, download the full builds located on each device forum. 

Cheers and happy coding!
