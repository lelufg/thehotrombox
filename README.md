Welcome to The HotROM Box Repo!
===================


Hey guys! I'm Spamtheboss (lelufg) and this is the Official HRB Repository. Here you can find all the source code of every single version of this Tool. You can also **Download** it and **Study** for yourself! 

----------


Starters Guide
-------------

This guide will teach you the basics of The HotROM Box.

> **Editing**

> - HRB just have **ONE** editable file: *hrb.bat*
> - If you want to help with the code, edit via Github OR upload to the git by yourself.
> - Make sure to know what strings you're editing, otherwise it can brick the code and the whole tool *(relax, I got a backup lol)*

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Translating

Yes, there will be translations releases for HRB as soon as I rebase all the code. And it will be soon.

#### <i class="icon-hdd"></i> Saving and using it

Github releases doesn't have team win recovery and such other files, as adb and fastboot. I only provide HRB and, after everything gets fixed, I push all together.

> **Fast hint:** If you want to test the whole package, download the full builds located on each device forum. 

Cheers and happy coding!
